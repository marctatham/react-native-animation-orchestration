# react-native-animation-orchestration

## Context
While currently still a work in progress, this repo is a basic
React Native project that exists to support an upcoming medium
article I'm putting together to demonstrate a simple technique
to orchestrating advanced sequencing of animations (and/or more)

In this Instagram-style story animation sequence, we work with 
- lottie animations (swapping animations in, playing animations at key intervals within the sequence)
- custom fading of elements in/out of the screen
- Timers
- interact with events that take place (such as a story segment completing) 
- react to human interactions (such as the user changing the current story segment)

Be sure to check back soon for the full supporting article as 
well as the finished codebase to accompany it.
